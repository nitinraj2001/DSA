A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children — usually called:

Left child

Right child

Each node contains:

Data (value)

Pointer/reference to left child

Pointer/reference to right child

        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6

⚙️ 2. Basic Terminology
Term	Meaning
Root	The topmost node (e.g., 1 in the example above)
Child	A node directly connected below another node
Parent	A node that has child nodes
Leaf	A node with no children (e.g., 4, 5, 6)
Siblings	Nodes having the same parent (e.g., 2 and 3)
Depth of a node	Distance (edges) from root to that node
Height of a node	Longest path from node to a leaf
Height of tree	Height of root node
Subtree	A tree formed by any node and its descendants
🌱 3. Types of Binary Trees
Type	Description	Example
Full Binary Tree	Every node has 0 or 2 children	✅
Perfect Binary Tree	All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaves are at same level	✅
Complete Binary Tree	All levels except possibly last are full, and nodes are as left as possible	✅
Balanced Binary Tree	Height difference between left and right subtree ≤ 1	✅
Degenerate / Skewed Tree	Each parent has only one child (like a linked list)	🚫
🔍 4. Tree Traversals

Tree traversal means visiting each node exactly once in a specific order.

(A) Depth-First Traversal (DFS)

Uses stack or recursion.

Type	Order	Example Output for Tree [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Preorder	Root → Left → Right	1 2 4 5 3 6
Inorder	Left → Root → Right	4 2 5 1 3 6
Postorder	Left → Right → Root	4 5 2 6 3 1
(B) Breadth-First Traversal (BFS)

Uses queue → Level by Level traversal
👉 Also known as Level Order Traversal

Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6

🧮 5. Common Operations
Operation	Description	Time Complexity
Insert	Add a new node	O(H)
Search	Find a value	O(H)
Delete	Remove a node	O(H)
Traversal	Visit all nodes	O(N)

🧠 Here, H = height of the tree
For balanced tree → H = log₂N
For skewed tree → H = N

🧠 6. Variants of Binary Trees
Tree Type	Description
Binary Search Tree (BST)	Left < Root < Right
AVL Tree	Self-balancing BST (height diff ≤ 1)
Red-Black Tree	Self-balancing BST using colors
Segment Tree	Used for range queries
Fenwick Tree (BIT)	Used for prefix sum problems
Trie	Used for storing strings efficiently
Heap (Binary Heap)	Complete tree with heap property (min/max)
⚡ 7. Time Complexities Summary
Operation	Balanced Tree	Skewed Tree
Search	O(log N)	O(N)
Insert	O(log N)	O(N)
Delete	O(log N)	O(N)
Traversal	O(N)	O(N)
