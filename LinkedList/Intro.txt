A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

In Java, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.
